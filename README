Intro
-----

Sample configs for using DJB's daemontools[1] as one of a million ways
to start/automatically restart/manage OpenSim-related [2] processes.
The following will give you OpenSim processes running in independent
GNU screen sessions for easy console access, and OpenSim processes
will be automatically restarted should they crash or exit.

This is just a quick go at it for folks looking for a starting point.


To Do
-----

* Right now timing of the process starts isn't addressed.  So your
region server will start at the same time as your asset server.  Which
could be problematic.  For now you can just attach to the console via
screen (e.g. 'screen -r opensim-region-server') and just ctrl-c to
restart it.

* 'stop daemontools' doesn't stop running OpenSim processes.


Assumptions
-----------

Right now assumes you're using upstart, hence /etc/event.d/daemontools
and that you're not already using daemontools for something else, hence
/etc/event.d/daemontools


Instructions for Ubuntu Jaunty (and probably other Ubuntu releases,
and probably Debian sid, and probably recent Fedora releases without
the apt stuff of course)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    # apt-get install daemontools

( the daemontools-run package isn't necessary )


    # git clone git://github.com/coyled/daemontools-for-opensim.git
    # daemontools-for-opensim/mklogdirs <user>

...where '<user>' is the user you run opensim as.

By default it'll have scripts to manage all 5 UGAIM processes + a
region server.  If, say, you only want to run a region server on this
machine, rm the relevant dirs in etc/service which you don't need,
e.g. daemontools-for-opensim/root/etc/service/opensim-asset-server

Edit etc/service/opensim-*-server/run if needed (e.g. to tell it
where your OpenSim binaries live).


    # cp -ar daemontools-for-opensim/root/* /
    # start daemontools

See 'To Do' section above for some current caveats.
