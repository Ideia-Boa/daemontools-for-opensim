Intro
-----

Sample configs for using DJB's daemontools as one of a million ways to
start/automatically restart/manage OpenSim-related processes.  This is
just a quick go at it for folks looking for a starting point.


To Do
-----

* Right now timing of the process starts isn't addressed.  So your
region server will start at the same time as your asset server.  Which
could be problematic.  For now you can just attach to the console via
screen (e.g. 'screen -r opensim-region-server') and just ctrl-c to
restart it.

* 'stop daemontools' doesn't stop running OpenSim processes.


Assumptions
-----------

Right now assumes you're using upstart, hence /etc/event.d/daemontools


Instructions for Ubuntu Jaunty (and probably other Ubuntu releases)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    # apt-get install daemontools

( the daemontools-run package isn't necessary )

    # cp -r daemontools-for-opensim/root/* /

By default it'll have scripts to manage all 5 UGAIM processes + a
region server.  If, say, you only want to run a region server on this
machine, rm the relevant dirs in /etc/service which you don't need,
e.g. /etc/service/opensim-asset-server

Edit /etc/service/opensim-*-server/run if needed (e.g. to tell it
where your OpenSim binaries live).

    # daemontools-for-opensim/mklogdirs <user>

...where '<user>' is the user you run opensim as.

    # start daemontools

See 'To Do' section above for some current caveats.
